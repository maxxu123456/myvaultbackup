Curiosity  
  
may have killed the cat; more likely  
the cat was just unlucky, or else curious  
to see what death was like, having no cause  
to go on licking paws, or fathering  
litter on litter of kittens, predictably.  
  
Nevertheless, to be curious  
is dangerous enough. To distrust  
what is always said, what seems  
to ask odd questions, interfere in dreams,  
leave home, smell rats, have hunches  
do not endear cats to those doggy circles  
where well-smelt baskets, suitable wives, good lunches  
are the order of things, and where prevails  
much wagging of incurious heads and tails.  
  
Face it. Curiosity  
will not cause us to die--  
only lack of it will.  
Never to want to see  
the other side of the hill  
or that improbable country  
where living is an idyll  
(although a probable hell)  
would kill us all.  
  
Only the curious have, if they live, a tale  
worth telling at all.  
  
Dogs say cats love too much, are irresponsible,  
are changeable, marry too many wives,  
desert their children, chill all dinner tables  
with tales of their nine lives.  
Well, they are lucky. Let them be  
nine-lived and contradictory,  
curious enough to change, prepared to pay  
the cat price, which is to die  
and die again and again,  
each time with no less pain.  
A cat minority of one  
is all that can be counted on  
to tell the truth. And what cats have to tell  
on each return from hell  
is this: that dying is what the living do,  
that dying is what the loving do,  
and that dead dogs are those who do not know  
that dying is what, to live, each has to do.
