A set of defined precise instruction / path to solve a problem

It has properties
1. Input
2. Output
3. Definite/Precise
4. Finite (cannot do infinite number of steps)
5. Correctness

Traveling Salesmasn is $O(n!)$

## Greedy Algorithm

- Can be used if trying to minimize or maximize
- Always make decision that seems best at the MOMENT.
	- No backtracking, changing decision
