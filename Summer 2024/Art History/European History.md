![[Pasted image 20240515133956.png]]
*Equestrian Portrait of Charlemagne*, c. 9$^{\text{th}}$ century. Bronze. Louvre, Pairs.

Charlemagne (748-814)
Dec 25, 800 CE
Holy Roman Emperor
New Constantine
Aachen, 794
Feudalism
Revival of Ancient ideas and art forms

Equestrian Portraits are only made for emperors. It is a big deal.
He started **feudalism**. Your title and rank is connected to land ownership..

## Romanesque Art and Architecture
11$^{\text{th}}$ and 12$^{\text{th}}$ century
It is a revival of interest in ancient things. There is a relative calm across Europe. Not much large wars. This allowed for a phenomenon called the Pilgrammage to take place. Thus, new art and architecture was created.

Pilgramge = Done by a pilgrim who is devoted to a religion that will travel to certain places to venerate relics. They would also receive indulgances. An indulgance is something that shortened your time in purgatory.

Relics can be fingernails, teeth, little bone fragments, little slivers of wood from Christ's cross. An entire body is a big deal.

Venerate vs Worship == Veneration is holding something in high regard. Worship is paying homage to.

There were 3 major destinatesions for pilgrammages.
1. Jerusalem
2. Rome
3. Santiago de Compostela(holds the entire body of St. James), Northern Spain


There were new developments to the Pilgrammage Church
Westwork = transitiion area for the entrance of the church. Replaced the atrium in older churches.

New aisle was added in the Transpt called the Ambulatory

There are semi circular mini apses. They are called apsidal Chapel. They hold the relics

The apse was extended to fit a section called the choir.

The aisle allowed pilgrems not not disturb mass.

They contained stone vaulted barrel vault arches on the ceiling.


## Gothic

Associate Gothic with france.

![[Pasted image 20240515140901.png]]
Notre Dame de Chartres Cathedral
![[Pasted image 20240515141008.png]]
Apsidal Chapels form a cohesive wall in the apse.

Clarestory consits of Lancet windows are 45 ft tall.

Stone Vaulted ceilings are above the clarestory. 

How to distribute weight of ceiling without crushing windows?

1. They used gothic arches, which are sharper arches, the pressure is steeper and more downward.
2. Instead of using barrel arch, they used intersections of multiple gothic arches. This is called a Ribbed Groin Vault
3. They used Buttresses on the Exterior which supported the exterior wall. They also used flying buttreese which are higher. They supported the springing pressure from the arches. They acted as supports.


## The Renaissance In Italy, 1300-1600

Important Topics
City-State
Unitification of Italy in 1848
Unification of Germany 1866-71

"Renaissance"
	Rinascimento
	Trecento (1300s)
	Quattrocento (1400s)
	Cinquecento (1500s)

Humanism - Focuses on Humans instead of just God
Relationship with the Divine


Religion of Trecento

Two People 
- St. Francis of Assisi (1182-1226)
- St. Thomas of Aquinas (Dominican Friar) - Interested in ancient times. He looked at ancient writings and tried to demonsrate that those writings were evidence of god.

Monks and Nuns belong to monasteries which belong to Monastic Orders. This class focuses on Mendicant Orders where members have to survive on donations.
Two importnat mendicant Orders
- Dominicans (St. Dominic (1170-1221)) - Hellfire and Brimstone. focused on saving your soul
- Franciscans - Like Hippies, focused on mans relationship to nature. When you look at a leaf, it is a sign of God's brillaince

In the 1500's , Giorgio Vasari wrote a book called *Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects*. 
- It is a watershed moment in art history

Vasari has 3 heroes of the book.
Parts
1. Giotto - infancy
2. Masaccio - Adolescence
3. Michelangelo - Adulthood

Before the Renaissance, artists were trained in workshops.

You start as apprentice and imitate masters style. You then become an assistant, who executes commissions by patrons. They were considered blue collared workers and low class.

Giorgio Vasari attempted to elevate the status of the artists to the level of emperors and saints, which led to artists becoming more known.

Guilds oversee the trade and commerce within a particular trade. It was a precursor of the modern union. Painters belonged to the apothecary guild. Sculptors belonged to the Stone and Wood masons guild.

If an assistant wants to become a master. They send a request to a guild, and the guild determines if they are capable based on a painting. This painting is called a **Masterpiece**. Assistants are usually in their 20s, no older.

Anonymous, *Hodegetria*

A Hodegetria, or Virgin Hodegetria, is an iconographic depiction of the Theotokos holding the Child Jesus at her side while pointing to him as the source of salvation for humankind. The Virgin's head usually inclines towards the child, who raises his hand in a blessing gesture. Metals are often used to draw attention to young Christ, reflecting light and shining in a way to embody divinity. In the Western Church this type of icon is sometimes called Our Lady of the Way.
