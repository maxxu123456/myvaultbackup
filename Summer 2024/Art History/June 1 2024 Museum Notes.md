Sabine Lepsius, *Self-portrait of Sabine Lepsius in 1885*

Created when she was 21 years old.

With the acceptance of women in the French royal academy. They were only allowed to paint still life’s and land scapes.

She wanted to be a portrait painter. She was initially trained by her father before her acceptance. She became a successful portrait painter. The self portrait is quite remarkable. It is not like the durer but it is connected to self fashioning. It is above the thigh and up and the body is turned. The pose is a pose of confidence. On one hand she has a pallete and the other hand has a paintbrush. She wants to be seen not as a noble but as a painter.
