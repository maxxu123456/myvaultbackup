Viennese secessionsists
A movement that’s connected to art nouveau. It was founded in 1897. The leader was Gustav Klimt. It is about seceding away from the Viennese royal academy. They wanted to re-invent visual representation. They went back and looked at gothic models. Wanted to establish timeline away from renaissance. There was emphasis on craft mentality. Often you’ll see there is a connection to symbolism, however symbolism was more of a French thing. In the 1880s France there is symbolism which was a reaction against realism and Impressionism. Symbolism wants to go back to the renaissance. Associate Klimt more with secessionist. In secessionist, there is a denial of space, things are more flat. There is also an emphasis on the psychological. A related concept in Munich was the fin de siecle. At the end of the 19th century(fin de siecle) there is a cultural anxiety. Typically at end of centuries there is anxiety. In Vienna there was a lot of industrial things going on, like electric tram and lighting and first international auto race. There was a rise of suicides and the rise of esoteric cults. There is a renewed German nationalism, which was a populist nonevent. Notability Hitler. Hitler appied twice to the Viennese academy but was denied. It culminated with the assasinatoon of duke Ferdinand. During the fin de siecle ther was intense financial speculation . Out of that we get the artist Egon Schiele who studied under Klimt. 

We associate Schiele with the Viennese expressionists. Schiele was a child prodigy. He did not grow up in an artistic family. He worked with Klimt from a young age. His career coincides with psychoanalysis by Sigmund Freud. Schiele becomes preoccupied with his own sexuality and ideas of self echoing. His painting deals with love solitude life and death. One of his painting was his seated self portrait. It has metaphysical and sexual aspects. He is trapped in the physical. He is often pressed up against the imaginary window of the picture and flattens himself against the window. In the Victorian era it was bad for women to show ankles, so basically there was a repression of sexuality. Schiele shows this tension in the painting. The stylistic characteristics of the secessionists include flattening of space and energetic nervous lines. We see an attempt to reshape reality, especially regarding g colors. Schiele uses colors very intentionally. The colors are emotional. When it comes to the seated self portrait he is wrenched up. There are nervous lines. His body is also truncated. This is the idea that we are not whole as human beings. A lot of bodies in painting during this time are incomplete. He also does landscapes. The landscapes are typically city scapes. They are very unusual.

Furniture

We will talk about Michael Thonet, 1796-1871. Early in his career he is interested in Bent veneer laminated wood. These are thin pieces of wood which are flexible and glued then put into a vice that are bent. He uses these to create unusual forms. The furniture was cheaper and stronger than hand carved furniture. He experiments with steam bending. He is best known for the chair no 14.

It is 6 pieces. It transformed the production of furniture.  Furniture used to produced in a workshop. He industrialized furniture making. Furniture can now be built in pieces, shipped flattened and then assembled. This was the idea that IKEA adopted. By 1904, his catalog was available in many languages and the no 14 chair was one of many in the catalog. He also produced the hardware for it and the furniture was shipped with tin screws and washers. 

The last furniture maker is Joseph Hoffman. He is an architect and designer. He is connected to the Viennese secessionists. He is a founding member along with Koloman Moser of the Wiener Werkstätte. This comes out of the Viennese secessionists. They turn from classical styles, and the workshop produced objects and leather paper ceramic and fashion and textiles. Sitzmaschine was a lounger designed by Hoffman. It was produced by J and J Kohn company. This was the rival of Thonet's company. He was inspired by Charles Rennie Mackintosh. He develops his own personal style that uses a wooden ball. It is both aesthetic and functional. The ball is at the join and obscures the screws. The chair was a commission from a nursing home outside of Vienna. The chair was part of the Gesamt Kunstwrerk which was the idea that everything inside a place was purposefully designed.

Italian Mannerism

Parmagianino, *Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror*
![[IMG_8271.jpeg]]
Not a religious work, but a self portrait 1524. This is the first record of an autonomous self portrait in Italy. This is a good 30 years after Durer’s. It was a gift to pope Leo 10. This speaks to renaissance gift giving: if I give you a gift you are indebted to me. Parmagianino expected commissions as a result. It looks like a convex mirror. It’s not flat. You will see that it looks unnatural. He is painting in the mirrors distortions. This is 1 in 5 autonomius self portraits in Italy in the 1520s. None that we know of in the 1530s due to the sack of Rome. Vaseri records this. We believe that the concept of the autonomous self portrait came to Italy through communications between Dürer and Raphael.

Benvenuto Cellini, *Cellini Salt Cellar*

We move on Ben venuto Cellini an Italian mannerist sculptor. He is the first generation of mannerist sculptors. Although he starts in Florence, he leaves and goes to France and works for king Francis the 1st and then returns to Italy. He is trained in goldsmith work. His famous work is a salt shaker. It is commissioned by king Francis 1. Salt during the renaissance was extremely expensive. People were paid in salt. The work is made of repusee. The work looks like solid good and looks impressive. It is a high point in renaissance metalsmith work. Underneath the object is 4 wheels. There are two vessels for salt and pepper. There are two figures Neptune and ceres. Ceres is the goddess of earth. Neptune is the god of the sea. These are the two ways you get salt. The bodies are elongated. In addition, there are impossible poses. It was stolen In 2003. It was found buried. 

Peter Bregeul 

He was not noticed until the 20th century. He introduced genre painting. They are everyday scenes not religious usually.

Pieter Bruegel the Elder, *The Peasant wedding*

We use this image to explained inverted perspective. The subject of the image is not at the foreground. The person in the green cloth is the bride and subject.

Pieter Bruegel the Elder, *Tower of Babel*. 

It is a biblical scene from the book of genesis. Everyone spoke the same language when in the grace of god. Humanity wanted to get closer to god so they built a tower. God didn’t like the tower and smashed it so difffere r languages form. It is very Italians since betel studies in Italy. He uses the knowledge of the colosseum to express the tower. There is also atmospheric perspective and a comprehensive landscape.

Pieter Bruegel the Elder, *Hunters in the snow*

It was a winter scene. Before this, winter scenes were small in illuminated manuscripts. They were associated with the labor of the month. Ex: planting seeds is associated with spring. We get every aspect of life in this town in the painting.

Johannes Vermeer, *Allegory of painting*, Dutch Baroque

He was art collector and dealer and painter. We see an artist at work painting a painting of a female in front of the window. You see the artist from the back who has no identity. There is a muse. They were the bringers of divine wisdom. Light filtering through the window hints at divine light. The idea of the curtain revealing the scene is associated with Caravaggio.

Caravaggio, *Madonna of the Rosary*

Altarpiece by caravagggio. There Is a red curtain that reveals the scene. This particular painting is problematic. It dates to 1606-1607. It is meant for the church. Of St Dominic at Naples. It was commissioned by Luigi carafa-colonna, who was part of the battle of La ponto. The last name means column. There is a very prominent column on the left. We assume that it’s for at Dominic since there are Dominic monks in the painting. We believe that the image is an **ex-voto**, which is an image given as a thank you for having prayers answered. The group of peasants is reaching forward the Dominic monk that is holding rosary beads. This is connects to the 1571 **Battle of Lepanto**
where the christians defeated the ottoman turks. This battle established the **Feast of Our Lady of the Rosary**. The night before the battle, the pope blessed the ships with rosary beads. This painting gives thanks to those events. Caravaggio was criticized for his ”realism”, specifically the dirty feet present in front of the virgin and child.
