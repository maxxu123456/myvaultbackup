Viennese secessionists review:

They are denying the traditions of renaissance by returning tot he gothic. These images are highly stylized.  Klimt  made a trip to Ravenna, Italy. It was the Byzantine capital of Western Europe during the 6th and 7th century. the church there San vitale has very important Byzantine mosaics. It transforms his type. After that point he uses a lot of gold and silver leaf and a jewel tone pallete. After 1903, Klimt uses a lot more jewel tone.

The kiss, 1907-1908(kemling said 1902?)

This a series of paintings that Klimt takes on during this periods. The kiss is not of romantic love. The kiss is conncected the Judas giving a Jesus the kiss, the kiss that led to crucifixtion. We see a male and female in a landscape. At the bottom there is a precipice and the woman that has the back from the cliff. As the man kisses her, her hand grasps his wrist. The woman intends to throw the man off the cliff. Klimt uses the idea of the femme fatale. This is a woman that uses her sexuality to pray upon men. Right at the beginning of the 20th century, woman suffrage begins to emerge. In 1904, there is the first woman suffrage conference in Europe. This is along with the rise of tea rooms in the 1880s in Europe. This is not a negative image by klimt of woman instead the painting is the challenging of the social norm. They are rejecting the Victorian culture, where women were oppressed. Other artists begin to depict femme fatales. <s>Solome is responsible for at John the Baptist and artists used Solome during this time. </s>
