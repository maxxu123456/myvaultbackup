Jan van Eyck (c. 1385-1441)


Court Painter
Diplomat
Oil Painting
External Exactness
Philip the Good, Bruges

Associate this period with the advent of oil painting. We had never seen it so widespread. Specifically Jan van Eyck we credit with pioneering the technique. Oil painting does not become a thing until the 1470s in Italy.

The stylistic trait that we associate with the northner rensssinace is external exactness: painting every single detail.

Van Eyck was a court painter for Philip the Good. Philip would give van eyeck commision. Van Eyck did not have to seek commissions, he would get them easily from philip the good.

Jan van Eyck, *Annunciation*, c. 1435-37. Nethlandish, Renaissance. Oil on panel (transferred to canvas since the panel was eaten by termites or worms)

Diptych - 2 paneled altarpiece
Triptych - 3 paneled altarpiece
Polyptch - more than 3 panels

Altarpieces would have hinges and would have images on the exterior and interior.

Annunciation: This is the momeent of impregation of virgin mary. The light which is of gold paint, is suggestive of virgin conception. It does not break the window. We see the words of the virgin mary. Her reply is written backwards and upside down, which means that the response is for god.

note: We explore the word as the agent of creation.

Jan van Eyck, *Arnolfini Wedding Portrait*, c. 1434. Oil on panel. 32" X 24"


![[Pasted image 20240620094733.png]]

This is at a time where wedding are not what you think they are. The notion of wedding during the renaissance was that you walked up to someone and said that you were married. Weddings were not regulated by the church. This image is unsual since you see a wedding take place. During the counter reformation, weddings started taking place, so there could be witnesses to the marriage. This marriage took place in Brugge between 2 italians. It speaks to the trade between Florence, Italy and Brugge which had been set up in the 12th century. There was constant communication between Bruge and Florence.

IN the background, tehre is a convex mirror that has 12 stations of the cross. Above it says "Jan van Eyck" was here to show that he beared witness to the wedding and as a signature. There is a self portrait of van eyck in the convex mirror.

On the left of the mirror, there are clear rosary beads that let light through, which again represents the virgin's virginity

By the left window, there is an apricot that is starting to shrivel, which is a reference to Adam and Eve.

Jan van Eyck, *Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele*


It is an image of a mystic vision: as you are praying in the state of devotion, then the image of the virign and child appear in front of you. This is evidenced by the implied line of the eyes. He does not directly look at the virgin and child. He is presented to the virgin and child by St. Donation, wearing the blue on the left, and St. George wearing the armor on the right.

There is the idea of sacracaversione: multiple people from different historical periods withihin the same space, which then suggests that the space is sacred.

Pay attention to the velvet Brocade that St. Donatian is wearing. The article of clothing has the quality of velvet. 

Verism: style from the republican period that captues all of the detail

St. George is painted with verism.

You can see a reflective self portrait in St. George's armor.

Jan van Eyck, *Ghent Altarpiece*, Exterior, 1432, Cathedral of St. Bavo, Ghent

11 ft, 5.75 in x 7 ft 6.75 in - closed

Commissioned by Jodicus Vijd and Isabel Borlut

Polyptych
Mundane palette


There is an idea of dualities in the altarpiece, opposing ideas. On the exterior, there is the use of mundane colors: earth tones or of this world. The patrons are on the very botton on the very left and very right. ON the upper half, there is a scene of the annunciation.

**Grisailles**: monochromatic painting meant to look liek sculpture. 


There is a painting of the landscape of Ghent. The biblical story takes place in a contemporary setting.


![[Pasted image 20240620100809.png]]
Interior

On the inside, there is a jewel tone palette. This is part of the duality. The jewel tone palette is suggestive to the heavenly Jerusalem according the book of Revelation. The bottom left panel is missing. There are 2 figures of adam and eve in the mundane palette. They are naked and shameful, which means that they are post expulsion. Since they are framed in the interior, it means that we would return to god. Adam's foot points out of the painting which is an example of foreshortening, because when you look up at Adam when you see the painting physically, it looks as if he is entering the space. Eve is not pregnant, she is the ideal woman in the 15th century. Eve has an unsual hairstyle. During the time, they would pluck their hairline to make their forhead look bigger. This is where the term "high-brow" came from.

The top center has an image of God the Father that looks similar to Christ. He is wearing **Papal Vestments**, **Papal Tiara**. There is a King's crown at the bottom. It is suggestive of 2 kingdoms, the kingdom of God, and the kingdom of Man. This is referred to as the realms, the **spiritual** realm, and the **temporal** realm.


![[Pasted image 20240620101617.png]]
The scene below god the father is the **Adoration of Lamb**

There are 2 rites of salvation. The Lamb is the **Agnus Dei**: the lamb of god. It is a reference to christ as the sacrificial lamb of god. On his chest, there is blood pouring out into the chalice, which is the **Eucharist**. There is also a fountain which is a reference to **Baptism**.

The instruments of the Passion are the instruments used to torture christ: The crown of thorns, the cross, the nails, column of flagellation, and the mace.

All of this is taking place in the **comprehensive landscape**: there is a conception of the whole world behind them.



On the central vertical axis, there is god the father, dove of the holy spirit, and the lamb of christ, which represents the Trinity.

There is a stream of water flowing from the fountain, which goes from god to the eucharist, baptism, and then you. You participating in the Eucharist is known in Heaven.

Van der Weyden, *Deposition*

This is noteworthy since it takes place in a shoebox theater. We connect this to a religious theater at the time, known as the passion plays, where they would recreate biblical stories on the stage. The detail is phenomonal. There is fresh blood coming out of christ. The tears are painted in extreme detail.


![[Pasted image 20240620102934.png]]
Van der weyden, *Crucifixiion*.

There is a device we associate with van der weyden, which is a notion of the **continious landscape**, where he unifies all 3 panels of the tryptich. The landscape continues through.
