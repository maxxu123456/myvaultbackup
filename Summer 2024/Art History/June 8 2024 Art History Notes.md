Bennozo Gozzoli, *Adoration of the Maji*, c. 1445. Chapel of the Magi, Palazzo Medici. Italtian Renaissance.

Self portraits are typically embedded in Biblical narratives and in prominent public commissions. This was used to garner more business for the artists. Gozzoli himself is in the painting.

Albrecht Durer, *Self Portrait*, 1484. German, Northern Renaissance Period. silverpoint. Inscription added in 1520s

This is the first example of a autonomous self portrait. Durer is very young in the portrait (12-15 years old). It is remarkable, since it is the conception of recording one's features purely for that purpose. This is connected to Humanism, which is connected to the study of man's accomplishments. Durer at the tender age is aware of his importance. His father was a silversmith. The drawing was executed in silver point. Instead of using lead, you use silver as a filament. You chemically treat the paper, and use silver to draw, and then the silver tarnishes, creating the line. Silverpoint was reserved for the masters only. The reason for this is that 1. silver was a precious material 2. it was a demonstration of your skill. In addition, it was a demonstration of your memory since the silver lines take time to show. In this painting, there is not a lot of chemical, thus it took longer to show, and the artists had to remember where he drew.

*Italianate Self-Portrait*, 1496 CE. German, northern Renaissance Period. Oil on Panel

Albrecht Dürer, *Self0portrait in a fur-lined Coat*, 1500CE. German, Northern Renaissance. Period. oil on panel

The image as 2 meanings, a universal meaning (elevation of artists to intellectuals) and a personal meaning (eternal salvation). They are both true.

*Pantocrator* Early 6th century

In *Pantocrator*, Christ does a gesture of benediction, which is a gesture of general blessing and is delivered above the heart. The two eyes are of different sizes, one eye is of our world, the other is not.


### Universal Meaning

However, in Dürer's painting, the gesture is turned inwards.


In this era, there is an interest in the physiognomy of christ.


In Vernoca's Veil, Christ creates a self portrait. The original self-portrait is inherently a Christian subject. We get to the idea of Christ being the original painter of the self-portrait.

Relating to the Genesis passage 1:26-27,
Dürer is creating his portrait in the image of Jesus. In the passage God is basically creating images of himself (humans). God is like an artist.

The difference between Dürer's and God's images, is that God gives life to his images. The turning of the gesture of benediction is denying the ability to bless. Dürer says that althoguh he looks like christ, he is not christ

There is an inscription ("I, myself, Albrecht Dürer of Nuremberg painted myself of indelible colors painted at age 28") in the portrait that is written in Latin as opposed to German, which appeals to a **universal** audience. The word indelible means permanent. The portrati is using a mundane pallete, meaning that the colors are earth tones. The colors are color fast, which means that they don't fade.

### Personal Aspect

There is a reflection of a cross in his left eye. His desire to look like christ is to be like christ in his actions. During this time, he was sick and bedridden. The *Nude Self-portrait*, 1500 was done as an exercise for his hand's dexterity. The idea of the indelible is related to the hope of salvation in *Self-portrait in a fur-lined Coat* compared to the rotting body in *Nude Self-portrait*.

Note: AD inscription on the left means Anno Domini and Albrecht Durer





## Sistine Chapel Ceiling

Patronage of Pope Julius II
- Giuliano della Rovere 
- Warrior Pope
- Nephew of Pope Sixtus IV
- New Christian Roman Empire
- Julius Caesar


Pope Julius II was called the warrior pope. Prior to his papacy, he was at war to reclaim papal land. He was the nephew of Pope Sixtus IV. della Rovere was the family named which means of the oak tree.

Pope Julius had the idea of a new Roman Christian Empire. He saw the grandeur of Rome, but it was pagan, so he wanted a great Christian state. He took his name from Julius Caesar, who was a Pagan.

### Fresco Technique

buon fresco - Buon fresco (Italian for 'true fresh') is a fresco painting technique in which alkaline-resistant pigments, ground in water, are applied to wet plaster.

a secco - Wall paintings done on dry plaster is called a secco (meaning “dry” in Italian); sometimes, details such as a face or decorative trim on textiles may be applied a secco on top of a fresco



This is used for large mural decoration for walls and ceiling. This is a permanent color fast technique. 

Techniques
- Pouncing (one of the two transfer techniques) - prick holes on contours of drawing, take a bag of charcoal dust, the dust goes through the holes. Connect the dots.
- Incising - taking a blunt instruemnt and scoring the countour of the cartoon into the surface of the plaster.


Steps
1. Bare Wall - A wall that has been prepped.
2. Arriccio - A material between the bare wall and the final layer.
3. Sinopia - A drawing on the wall to work out the composition. A layout that checks if the painting works.
4. Intonaco - A thin layer of plaster that covers up the Sinopia.
5. Cartoon - made from the sinopia
6. Pigment - The plaster must be wet for the fresco technique to work. You have to paint the fresco piece by piece. A days work is called a **Giornata**. The pigment and plaster chemically bond together through carbonization.

A secco colors tend to be blues, since it doesn't mix well with plaster.

Michelangelo, *Sistine Chapel Ceiling*, c. 1508-1512 and *Last Judgment*, 1537-1541, Fresco, Sistine Chapel, Vatican, Rome

It was commissioned from Pope Julius II

The ceiling is from the book of genesis. This is most important painting in western art. No one had painted a narrative on a ceiling like this. Every artist that went to Rome saw this ceiling.

When Michelangelo first sees the ceiling, it is decorated with blue dotted with yellow stars. Michelangelo came down to the chapel to sculpt the tomb of Pope Julius II. Since there was war, funds were diverted away from the tomb. Pope Julius then asked Michelangelo to paint the sistine chapel ceiling, which was much cheaper. This was basically busywork meant for Michelangelo, since the pope didn't want to lose him. The signing bonus for michelangelo was around $250,000. The entire project, he was paid around $3 million.

When michelangelo received the origainl commission, the pope wanted the 12 apostles. Michelangelo said he could do something better. In the barrel vault, there are 9 scenes from the book of genesis.

*Temptation and Fall of Adam and Eve*

This painting is called a **continuous narrative**: there are multiple points of a narrative depicted on a single frame.

There are poetic aspects of the scene. Eve is notably muscular. Adam is based on the sculpture called the Belvedere Torso Trunk. Eve is in a similar position, just reversed. Italians use the torso for the trunk of a tree. If we think of god the father as the tree, then there are 2 branches that stem from it that represent Adam and Eve. Michelangelo uses the trunk to convey that Adam and Eve come from the same place. The garden of eden contains a lot of raw rock, which Michelangelo would rather be carving instead. The trunk is a double entendre.

*Creation of Adam*

It speaks to our desire as human to witness divine acts. Adam has been formed on the left. God is rushing in from the right (seen from the billowing of the red garmet) and almost touches Adam's finger giving him life. We are denied from seeing this divine act. The countour line from Adams left pec to the toe is the same as the one found on God the father. Michelangelo poetically creates the image of Adam from God.

In this period, the idea that all thought happens in the brain is not fully formed, so the red garmet is not the brain.

After painting the first few scenes, Michelangelo realizes that huamsn cannot see the scnes from the ground. Aftewards, michelnagelo makes the scenes visible from the ground.

Titian. *Venus of Urbino*, c. 1538. Oil on canvas. Commissioned by Duke Guidobaldo della Rovere of Urbino

The notion of color dominates first is seen here, **Colore**.

Titian uses a technique called **alla prima**, where the paint goes directly on the canvas. There is **no underdrawing**. This is opposite of **disegno**.

Venus is in a 16th century domestic interior and looks at us. 

The myrtle tree out the window and roses in her hand are both associated with venus.

In the background, the two chambermaids are interacting with the chest called the Cassone, which is given to brides on their wedding days, so we have the association with marriage.

The dog at the foot is a small lap dog. Lap dogs in the renaissance were associated with luxury, since these dogs were purely for leisure and didn't serve any useful purpose. The second association of the dog is fidelity or faithfullness. This is why the most common name for a dog used to be fido.

Venus is masturbating. It was believed that if the bride masturbated before intercourse, there would be a higher chance of conception. This is associated with fertility.

By calling the women Venus, it permits the viewer to look at her.

In Giorgione's *Sleeping Venus*, venus is depicted sleeping, which contrasted with venus of urbino. The duke expected sleeping venus, but got venus of urbino.

Sleeping Venus is considered nude.



## 19th Century

Edouard Manet (1832-1883)
- French Realist, paints what you bear witness to
- upper middle class

![[Pasted image 20240608114912.png]]
Edouard Manet. *Olympia*, 1863. French, Realism. oil on canvas.

This painting is the exact same size as *Venus of Urbino*

A chambermaid is offering Olympia flowers. Olympia has flowers in her hair. She is a prostitute. Olympe is slang for a prostitute. In this period, prostitutes were commonplace, but it was part of the culture to not talk about it. Manet's painting was scandalous at the time. Olympia's left hand covers her geniatlia which means that the painting is not about fertility. There is a cat on the bed that is alert which represents promisciuity. 

Charles Baudelaire - French writer, critic wanted artists to properly depict the nude. He believed that *Doryphoros* was the proper use of the nude. Baudelaire thought that painting a nude women should only be a goddess. Manet goes against this by painting a prostitute.
