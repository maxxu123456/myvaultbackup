Albrecht Altdorfer, *The battle of Alexandria at Issus*

He was also an engraver. We really see him as the first renaissance artist to embrace landscape. The landscape is a setting for an epic battle. Typically you would see the emphasis on the battle and not on the landscape. However here the landscape is dominant. This is the battle between Alexander the Great and Darius of Persia. 333 bce. It is one of three battles between the two. In particular, this battle is represented a lot due to the morals it tell. Although Alexander the Great was outnumbered, his calm nature allowed him to win. Darius acted emotionally and with a lot of hubris. the attire doesn’t fit the time period of the 4th century. It looks more like 16th century. This is called **anachronism**. It is where objects are in different periods. It was commissioned by the Duke of Bavaria for his palace. In this period the Europe goes to war with the ottoman Turks. The painting dates from 1529 and is oil on panel.

Rogier Van Der weyden , *St Luke drawing the Virgin Mary*

He is considered along with van eyck the leaders of the northern renaissance. We have saint luke on the right who is in the process of drawing the virgin and the child. If you look closely the drawing is actually silverpoint.  We believe this to be a self portrait of van der weyden. When you see a painting where st Luke is painting the virgin and the child, it is typically a chance for the author to include a self portrait as st Luke. 

This is also connected to guilds. The painters in the north belonged to the guild of st luke.

Albright Durer 1526, the four apostles

Durer has made 2 trips to Italy. Scholars want to paint to this painting as evidence that he saw paintings by Giotto. The clothes are very full and girthy which is unusual for durer. We think he stopped in Padua at the arena chapel.

Francesco Salviati, charity

He was primarily working in Rome and Florence. This is mannerism painting, since unnatural colored are used. There is a compositional circle which rejects the idea of the triangle which is typical of the mannerism period. It uses cangiante.

cangiante: iridescent effects


Peter Paul Rubens

He is a Flemish baroque painter. He spends 8 years in Italy. He studies the work of Michelangelo and Titian. Peter Paul Ruben’s goes back and establishes the largest workshop in the history of the west. Lots of drama in the painting and momentary action. Subjects are put up to the foreground. The women in his painting are all similar and are called Rubenesque women.

The fall of the damned, Peter Paul Ruben’s. 

What unusual about the last judgement is that the compositional aspects are confusing. The last judgment stands out against the orderly Sistine chapel ceiling. This painting is compositionally confusing like the last judgement. 


Canalleto

Italian artist of the rococo period from Venice. He gets his nickname since he paints Canal. There is a phenomenon called the grand tour. It was a way to educate the social elite. The English would hire a French guide to take them across Europe. The main cities were Paris Geneva Milan Florence Venice Rome and Pompeii. Each iternary were custom to a persons interests. Canalleto would paint scenes of the city where the travelers would buy these as postcards.
