3 artsists

Ernest Ludwig kirchner 1880-1938

1 of 4 founding members of die brücke. This translates to the bridge. Their objective was to bridge Germany  from medical renaissance period to the 20th century. Founded in 1905 in Dresden. All of them worked together until 1913. This connects tot he larger group of German expressionists. They are expressing extreme emotion which mean the compositions tend to be agitated. You see the use of unnatural color. People tend to not like these paintings.

Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, *Circus \[Girl Circus Rider\]*

The circus 1913
At theme end of the 19th century circus were common topics. Circus performers were in the fringe of society. Circus performers typically were American or African. The use of horses were associated with America and the exotic which challenged European social normal. It relates to disenfranchisement. It speaks to a metaphor that many people felt disenfranchised by Victorian ideals in the 20th century.

Pablo Picasso

Earliest form of cubism is called analytic cubism which Picasso developed with George Braque. A lot of people credit Braque with developing it, but Picasso made use of this. Braque served in ww1 and stopped painting. Analytic cubism is taking a 3d object in a 2d surface. Objects would be unfolded and spread out on the surface. Paintings become non representational. Woman with violin is analytic cubism.

The second type is synthetic cubism which was more collage like. This would dominate Picasso later career. This is post 1912.

Pablo Picasso, *Woman with a Violin*


Woman with violin contains music and art. Both are non representational. They are abstract. 


Max Beckmann 

Born in Leipzig. He parcipaed in the Neue Sach Lich Keit exhibition. It translates to new objectivity. We associate with max highly personal subject matter. They are allegorical and idiosyncratic. Max Beckmann is doom and gloom. He not a really happy painting kind of guy. A lot of subjects lack spiritual redemption which connects with max’s history. In 1937, hitler forms an exhibition known as degenerate art which includes all 3 artists. Hitler advocated for a more academic style that was more neo classical. Hitler showed the Germans what not to like. Beckmann leaves Germany and goes to Amsterdam and then emigrates to the US to teach and washu then at Brooklyn.

Max Beckmann, *Before the Masked Ball*

There are 2 groups of 3 waiting for a masked ball. They are in forever waiting, the party never comes. There is no psychological exchange between the 6. They are emotionally isolated. The painting rejects the Victorian norms. Victorian norms led to ww1. All of the leaders that led to ww1 were descents from queen victoria.
