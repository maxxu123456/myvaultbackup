Parmigianino, *Madonna of the Long Neck*, 1534. oil on panel. Italian, Mannerism. 85" x 52"

Commissioned by Elena (Translated into English as Helen) Baiardi for Baiardi Chapel, Santa Maria dei Servi, Parma

*Madonna of the Long Neck* is Rarified Form, which celebrates uncommon traits. It is a rejection of idealization (think *Doryphorus*). Parmagianino's painting did not show bones inside hands, they were like rubber.

Elena's father, Francesco, was a Poet, which was considered the highest form of creativity during the Renaissance because it only requires the mind.

This painting is unique since the artwork was commissioned by a woman. It was also prominent since **the artwork is meant for the altar of the family's burial chapel**, which was very significant. 

There are 2 pillows underneath her foot, which is also used in Donatello's St. Mark. However, Madonna of the long neck's pillow is not compressed like St Mark's. She's floating.

Donatello, *St. Mark*

There are creases in the pillows in St. Mark by Donatello. This means that Donatello has gravity. 


### Iconography of the Madonna of Long Neck
![[Pasted image 20240523102850.png]]
- The Urn that is being held is made of Lapis Lazuli
	- Also painted in ultramarine
- Lapis was extradinaraliy expensive at the time
- 3 Interpretations of the Urn
	1. Vessels are Anthropomorphic, non human thing with human traits. The base of the urn is called the foot. The middle section is called the body (or belly). The top opening is called the mouth. The transition from the body to the mouth is called the shoulder. If there are handles, they are called ears. The long part connecting the shoulder and the mouth is called the neck. In this painting, the neck is very long, which is similar to how long the neck of Madonna is. **Madonna is the vessel of christ.**
	2. There is a reflection of the cross on the right edge of the urn. Jesus says he is the Alpha, Omega, and the Beginning and the End. **The vessel is the Beginning, and the cross is the end. Christ in the picture is in a crucified pose.** 
	3. Elena, or Helen is the patron. Another Helen is Constantine's mother, who was a Christian and later granted sainthood. While she was alive, she went on pilgrimages to find the **cross**. **This painting also refers to Constantine's mother, Helen**. 
A strap appears across Madonna's chest. 

Background:


*Diana*. Greek. Hellenistic Period.

In this sculpture, Wet drapery is where the garmet clings to the body. In greece, all gods took human form. Wet drapery shows the human form.

Diana was a virgin goddess.

Michelangelo's *Pieta* was commissioned by a French cardinal.
![[Pasted image 20240523104301.png]]
Michaleangelo, *Pieta*

When it was first shown, people tried to figure out who made it, many people thought it was Gobo. Michaelangelo was upset, so he carves a strap into the sculpture that explicitly states that Michaelangelo was the sculptor.

In both in *Madonna of long neck*, it is the first time the virgin holds the christ child. In *Pieta*, it is the last time the virgin holds the christ child.

People were expected to make the connection between the *Pieta* and *Madonna of Long Neck*.

In both works of art, the virgin is relatively huge.

Michelangelo's *Pieta* was criticized when it was carved. Her age does not seem to fit the image, she appears way to young. Michelangelo's response was chased women never age. This is a symbol of her **chastity**. Some may argue the *Pieta* was the first example of rarified form. 

Sacra Conversazione - meaning sacred conversation usually refers to paintings with historical figures from different periods

Feast Day is an important celebration in One's life. We celebrate our birthday's in the west because of Michaelangelo. Michaelangelo's birthday party caused birthdays to be celebrated.

In altarpieces, the selection of Saints if very deliberate.

Eugene Delacroix, *Death of Sardanapalus*, 1827, oil on canvas. Louvre, Paris

The use of Pompeii Red in this painting is Ironic.

Uses an account of Lord Byron, *Sardonapalus*, 1821, which was a play.

It is about the Assyrian King, who was notabilty not Greek or Roman.

According to history, the king was selfless and sacrificed himself for the people. However, by the play of Lord Byron and the art of Delacroix, the people are dying, and the King is indifferent. This is attack of institutional authority.

Requirements of a chair.

During this period, there was a questioning of traditional European values. 



![[Pasted image 20240523113107.png]]
Unknown, *Rocking Chair*, e. 19th century. American, Shaker. Mahogany, Straw, Birch

Shaker furniture did not contain many fancy ornamentations. Ornamentations were sinful. Up until the begningi of the 20th century, Americans did not have a traditional furntiure style. They were dependent on European models such as the Herter Brothers. At the beginning of the 20th century, American's wanted to claim their own style, which was the Shaker furniture style. Danish people learned from the Shaker style. It feels comforting to Americans.

Herter Brothers, *Side Chair*, c. 1882. American, Art Nouveau. Gilded maple, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, and modern upholstery

Hans Wegner, *Round Chair* ("*The Chair*"). 1949. Danish, Mid-century Modern. Teak, Caning

Design is different than art in 1 important aspect. Design is about problem solving. Design solves some problem.

Chairs are a unique aspect of furniture. Chairs are historically significant. For example, the idea of a throne of a seat of authority. The only person seated in the course would be the king. Most peasants did not have chairs, they had benches. They are also a unique design challenge. They need to be comforatble. They also need to be aesthetically pleasing. They also need to be structurally sound.

Hans Wegner's *Round Chair* fit all of these characteristics. Both JFK and Nixon sat on these chairs during the presidentail debate. The chair may also be called the Kennedy Chair.
