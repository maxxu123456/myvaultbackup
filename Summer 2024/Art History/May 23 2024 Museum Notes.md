Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts, *Trompe l'oeil med*

Example of Flemish baroque. Response to Protestant reformation . Emergence of non religious subject matters. It is breaking the pictorial plane. It is purposely deceptive. It’s a painting that’s being peeled off the wall. The skull in trump lloyd painting represent memento mori. They are a reminder of death. Focus on eternal salvation. 1668-1672 is where he created these images for the king.

  Pieter Aertsen, *The Fat Kitchen*


We are seeing the emergence of the response of the counter reformation. In the north they did not like religious imagery. This was Dutch mannerism. It is a genre scene, a scene of everyday life. It conveys a sort of morality. It explores voleptus carni. Gluttony and drunkenness. The peasant couple outside is very envious of the food. We see the rise of new social economic changes. There is a rise of the merchant middle class. There is a new phenomenon of the development of the art markets. One of the leading cities is Antwerp.
