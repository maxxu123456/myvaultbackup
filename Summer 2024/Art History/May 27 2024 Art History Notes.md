Ghirlandaio, *Giovanna Tornabuoni*, 1488

In the 15th century, women were usually depicted in Profile, which is from the Side View. These were usually created for marriage. From her clothes, she is wealthy. From the Rosary beads, she is Pious (not Catholic as Protestnant Reformation has not yet occured). Marrying for love is a 19th century ideal. Before then, it was like a business contract.

The Mona lisa is wearing black clothes, which is worn by the Wealthy. She wears a diaphorus hood. At the time, married women would wear that hood. She was already married at the time of the painting. Contrary to popular belief, the eyes don't follow you. Having the Mona Lisa face the viewer is revolutionary. Open Mouths were seen as offensive, so Mona Lisa is not bearing her teeth when smiling. The patron was Lisa's husband. "La Gioconda". The landscape in the background is not welcoming and hard to navigate. The landscape may represent a warning to her husband "be wary of what lies behind your wife's smile". Lisa is the sitter. Mona means lady.

sfumato - smokiness, overall hazyness

Leonardo believed the best time to paint a portrait is in the evening when the light is dispersed.

Leonardo da Vinci, *Ginevra de' Benci*, 1474/78

The bush in the painting is a Juniper bush. Ginervra translates into Juniper. The bush is a visual pun. Leonardo always includes a pun on the sitter.

Michelangelo, *David*, 1501-4. Italian, high Renaissance. Cararra marble. Commisioned by Opere del Duomo (Translates to the works of the church which oversaw decoration of the baptistry)

Goliath was a Phillistine conquerer.
David uses his sling to hid Goliath in the forehead and kills him. David then grabs Goliath's sword and cuts off his head. Since David was at a disadvantage, it was seem as a miracle by god.

David is connected to Florence

Michaelangelo created David that contains no icongraphy that can easy identifity the structure as David.

The statue is very large as is reffered to "Il Gigante"

It is **Colossal** - 17 feet tall or 3 times the scale of huamns

Michelangelo things back to the Doryphorus and uses the Contrapposto pose.

The hero is between the mortals and immortals. David is a hero. He is elevated above the mortals. michaelangelo poetically depics david, as he was a poet.

Michelangelo is about the inner psychology of the individual, as you can tell by *David*'s face.

Donatello, *David*, c. 1420-40s. Italian, Renaissance. Bronze.

This was the first life-sized Bronze Sculpture since ancient Rome. He is wearing a shepherd's hat. Goliath's severed head is at the base. The sword is in his right hand. The left hand is the evil hand. The right hand is righteous.

Donatello was unsure of the stability of bronze, so just to be safe, he uses the sword as support. He thinks of bronze of marble.
