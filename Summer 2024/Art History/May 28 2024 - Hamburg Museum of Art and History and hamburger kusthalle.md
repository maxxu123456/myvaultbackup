Art Nouveau means the new art. This is end of the 19th century.

Characteristics
Repeated use of organically curved undulating (rise and fall) lines. 

Rejection of widespread use of 19th century forms, no Greek and Roman

Uses a lot of botanical references

It is an international style

There are 5 majors centers
- Brussels
- Glasgow
- Munich
- Vienna
- Barcelona

Connected to a cultural phenomenon called the fin-de-siecle which is the end of the 19th century.

Each center has its own unique twist to it. In Munich the style is jugendstil. In Vienna the style is called the sucessions. In Glasgow, the style moves away from the organic and focuses more on geometric shapes, but still connected to plant forms.

Charles Renni Mckintosh
He is from Glasgow. He designed some chairs for tea room in Glasgow.

Tea rooms start to emerge in the 1890s. During the Victorian period women had few opportunities to gather publicly. Women could gather here. We see the rise of women’s suffrage. Willow tea room chair. Argyle tea room chair.

It is a high baked chair that is rigid in its rectilinear form. 1903. The reason for its formality was because it was at the front of the tearoom.

## Hamburger Kunsthalle

Amsterdam rise of the calvanists. Calvanists believe in predestination. Only a select number of souls are saved from birth. They don’t believe in the need for religious imagery. It leads to idolatry -worship of images. Their churches are whitewashed. With Emmanuel Dewitt, his painting were destroyed.  Piotr Saran 1597-1665 credited with first church interiors that includes painting of the church. Emmanuel’s painting is of the church interior. He conflates space. He borrows ideas from other churches for paintings. He manipulates the placement of furniture. The church is both is and is not a church. The churches are mostly whitewashed but sprinkled with religious imagery. One painting is the old church from Amsterdam, on the right hand side is a pier and there is a small black memorial. They are reserved for heroes of military victories and honored citizens. They are juxtaposed with two figures below that are unimportant. Pay attention to Dewitt’s juxtapositions.

Jan massys - Flora 
Jan is associated with Antwerp- modern day Belgium. His father was a very prominent painter. Northern renaissance painters were split into 2 groups. One group traveled to Italy and were called italianate painters. Jan was one of these. The other did not travel to Italy. He is associated with Joachim Patinir. Patinir was famous for his landscapes, specifically atmospheric landscapes. Atmospheric perspective is the observation of atmospheric effects. Farther away things are more hazy. She is an allegorical figure for Flora. Her body is classically inspired like an ancient sculpture. She looks more stone like than flesh. The architecture is classically inspired.

Paris bordone.
Venetian renaissance. It is the antithesis of the florentine renaissance style. It is a conceptual difference in the way they approach painting. For florentiens they follow disegno which says that drawing is the starting point of all art. With the venetians they followed follows colore which means that all painting start with color. Associate Venice with landscape, we start to see the emphasis on landscapes in Venetian painting. Venice does not have a lot of land. Venice started to use canvas. Canvas doesn’t warp in high humidity. Panel is heavy. Bordone studied with Titian. The subject is shiba at the well. In David and Goliath, David is king. David sees a shiba the wife of one of his soldiers. David has an affair with her and she becomes pregnant. David asks her husband to sleep with his wife. The husband says no. David sends the husband to the front lines killing him. Shiba marries David and has another child called Solomon. Up till the renaissance the story was seen as a moral story. It was seen as the shiba committing adultuery. In the 16th century, she became seen as the victim of David’s power. The fountain is a double entendre, she cleans herself using it and it also serves as a baptismal cleansing. The top of the fountain contains a goose or eagle. This could be a parallel another story from classical mythology. Zeus become a swan and seduced leida. The idea of imperial power seducing a women is emphasized.

Casper David Friedrich
Wanderer above the sea of fog. He is a German romantic painter. We define romanticism as the rejection of institution. It is the championing the individual over the institution. It is right at this time where Germany is a loose collection of 300 city states. There was discussion of unifying Germany. Napoleon wiped out the notion of the German nationalistic state. The painting reflect this desire for the German nationalistic state that was then lost. An 18th century philosopher called edmund Burke. He advocated for the sublime and picturesque. The picturesque is idealistic. The sublime is feeling small like facing the hurricane. The second philosopher kosergarten. He advocated that experiencing god was through nature. This is the continuation of St Francis’s thought.Friedrich combines the sublime and nature to express the loss of the German nationalistic state. The historiography of Fredrich is controversial. Hitler latches onto the idea that friedrich was a good nazi painter. It is only recently that we separated friedrich from hitler. The painting is not directly a self portrait  but acts as a metaphorical self portrait. We see ourselves in the situation. He looks over a precipice. It is a moment of contemplations. We look small. The landscape is harsh and barren. Uncertainty lies before us.
