Unknown French (?) artisan, *Le Bois Protat*, *Crucifixion*, (obverse) c. 1380-1400. Woodcut 23 1/2 x 9 inches

Printmaking starts along the Rhine valley, near western Germany, near France. The earliest prints are connected to the history of textiles.

Unknown German artisan, *St. Dorothy* c. 1420. Woodcut.

It quickly becomes popular, especially along pilgrimage routes. You would see images such as above. Basically the monastery would start producing these. The monks that were making these were referred as Jesus makers. The pilgrim would buy it as an amulet, it would offer protection to the pilgrim on their journey. We do they they would stitch them on the inside of their clothes and in some cases ingest them. This early printmaking is characterized by
1. Bold broad coutour lines, No sense of volume
2. They tend to be copies of paintings

Votive prints = devotional imagery

Master of the Playing Cards, *The Queen of Flowers*, c. 1430-1440. Dry-point Engraving, 5 1/8 x 3 5/8 in. (13x9.1 cm)

We start to move into metal plates, which are more durable. This leads to a new type of print making called **Intaglio**, which means to cut into or incise. You cut into the metal, which is a trough that represents the line. In the old wooden way, you would cut around the line, and the line would be a raised edge. 

They hand-rubbed the paper onto the metal plate. This led to slightly variability between prints as the paper moves a bit. In the 15th century, we start to get **Tonal Hatching** which includes a series of parallel lines that indicate volume.



In the 15th century, Johannes Gutenberg  creates the Printing Press, c. 1439 - 1440

We no longer use hand rubbing, and switch to a press.

Martin Schongauer, *Censer*, c. 1480-5, Northern Renaissance. Engraving

The origin of using metal plates goes back to the traditions of metal smithing. Metal smiths would creates objects such as the censer that's then carved into for decoration. The notion of using these tools for intaglio comes from metal smithing. Censer's would be used in mass for churches. Priest would light incense inside of it and swing is back and forth which would purify the church.

It notably uses cross hatching, parallel lines intersecting parallel lines, to create a sense of volume. 


## German Renaissance

Terms:
- Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528)
- Born in Nuremburg
- Painter, Printmaker, Theoretician
- Self-fashioning

![[Pasted image 20240531105916.png]]
*Italiante Self-Portrait*, 1496 CE. German, Northern Renaissance Period. Oil on panel.

Autonomous self portraits were self portratis of artists that were not commissioned

Self fashioning is painting the elevated version of youself. In Dürer's self portrait, he dresses very nobly.

![[Pasted image 20240531110412.png]]
Albrecht Dürer, *Knight, Death, Devil*, 1513. German, Renaissance. engraving

![[Pasted image 20240602151309.png]]
Albrect Durer, Adam and Eve (Fall of Man), 1504. Engraving. German, Northern Renaissance Period.

This engraving will help define nude and naked. This concept of nude/naked goes back to Adam and Eve. Nude is the glorification of the human form. It is connected to Adam and Eve while they are in the garden of Eden. The man and the women is unaware of their body. For example, Michelangelo's *David* would be nude. Naked is the opposite, it is connected to the concept when Adam and Eve and expelled from the Garden. Adam and Eve cover themselves after being expelled. It conveys awareness and shame. Naked is connected to vulnerability as Adam and Eve could now die.

Dürer did spend time in Italy. He met Michelangelo. Later, he writes letters to Raphael. In Dürer's sketches, Dürer plans Adam's pose to be of Apollo Belvedere.

There is a cat and a mouse at the bottom. It was belived that Eve was the cat and Adam the mouse. Eve preyed on Adam.

### Lucas Cranach
Lucas Cranach the Elder was at the center of the Protestant reformation since he was friends with Martin Luther. He spread ideas of the reformation.

![[Pasted image 20240531112451.png]]
*Adam and Even*, 1533. Oil on panel. German, Northern Renaissance. Staatliche Museen, Berlin.

The painting expresses ideas of the sacred and the profrane = Heaven and Earth.

The Humors are the vials in the body related to the four vials. When Adam and Eve in the garden, the vials were in equal harmony with each other. When they were expelled, and when the vials would be out of balance, and you would experience sickness.

The four humors are
1. Choleric - impatience, pride, wraith (Cat)
2. Melancholic - bitterness, despair, avarice (Elk)
3. Phlegmatic - laziness, gluttony (Ox)
4. Sanguine - overly active, lust (Rabbit)

The darkness is a metaphor for the naive nature. "They are in the dark". 


#### Fresco
For fresco images, the artist first draws the image on a piece of paper, which is then imprinted on the wall. The piece of paper would be called the **Cartoon**


## German Romanticism
Terms:
- Casper David Friedrich (1774-1840)
- Edmund Burke, 1757
- Gotthard Ludwig Kosegarten
- Sublime
- Picturesque

Casper David Friedrich is known for the sublime - the feeling of being small, the moments of awe. Picturesque is the opposite of this.

Kosegarten advocated that you experienced God through nature.


![[Pasted image 20240531120615.png]]
Casper David Friedrich, *Cross in the Mountains (Tetschen Altar)*

This is the first time as we see landscape as the subject of an altar. The focus is on the landscape, not on the actual scene of the crucifix. It is the landscape that Friedrich uses to explore the Kosengarten and Burkian concepts.


![[Pasted image 20240531120903.png]]
*Monk by the Sea*

This is a landscape painting. The earliest landscape paintings that we have go back to the 14th century. Eventually landscape becomes an idea of the French Royal Academy. They tend to be tiny little views of the land. Friedrich takes a different approach to landscape. It is a seascape. There is a storm that represents Napoleon.

The monk is a **Capuchin** monk. The Capuchins were an order that are identifiable by their clothes which have a hood. The storm foreshadows Napolean. By placing the monk in that place, it is a meditation of death. This is where we feel small.



![[Pasted image 20240602145555.png]]
*Abbey in the Oak Forest*

There are a procession of monks carrying a casket through the ruined church. We see a cemetery on both sides. This tackles the sublime since it includes the theme of death.  This also ties into the ideas of Kosegarten, since the cathedral is domainted by oak tress. It is as if the pillars of the columns are the trees themselves. The gothic arch, crescent moon, and the death oak trees are associated with the german nationalistic state. The dead oak trees represent the dead dreams of the future state.





These 2 painting were theorized to go together. During this time, A unified german state did not exist. There were talks, but Napoleon destroys the hopes of unification. In 1871, Germany is unified. These 2 paintings deal with the loss of the German national state.

The idea of the open window is a sense of longing. It becomes a theme with painters in the period expressing the loss of the German national state.
