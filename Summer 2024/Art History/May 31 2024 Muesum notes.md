May 31 2024 Art history museum notes

Carlo bugatti 

1856-1940 born in Milan and worked there a while then moved to France.
  

He is an art nouveau designer. The Italian version of it. You will see a lot of asymmetrical forms. Lots of different influences. First is Romanesque. Then Islamic architecture. Egyptian. Japanese graphic forms. For Islamic, you see onion shaped openings and the horseshoe arch. You will see a technique called ebonizing which is a chemical reaction. There is also a mixed use of materials. There is a whiteish creaming material called vellum made of animal hide. You will also see metalwork embossed in a process called repoussé. You will see the use of cullinwttes and inlay. You will find the furniture is quite architectural. Vignette you will be looking at dates near 1890.

On vellum you will see birds and painted animals which is the Japanese graphic influence.
