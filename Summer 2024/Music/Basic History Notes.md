Music: Sound organized in time

Melody and Harmony = sound

Rhythm = time

Melody = succession of generated frequencies (pitches) perceived as a whole (unity)

Melodies are usually singable and memorable

## Melody
- often the center of the composition
- in longer works, melodies may be referred to as themes
- melodies or themes are subject to variation and development

## Pitch-Frequency
- a specific sound expressed by name and vibrations per second(vps)
- 12 pitches are represented by 7 alphabet letters sometimes with modifiers:
	- flat signs (b)
	- sharp signs (#)
- A2 = 220
- A1 = 110
- A3 = 440
- A4 = A880
- A5 = 1760

## Interval

- The distance between 2 pitches
- Intervals can be expressed specifically  (2nds, 3rds, 4ths, 5ths, etc.)
- Intervals can also be expressed comparatively (small/narrow, medium, large/wide)
- The smallest distances between two notes are half steps and whole steps: these intervals are the basic material of scales and modes


## Ancient Western Roots
- Pythagoras and Ptolemy observed physical properties of vibrating bodies
- halving a string double the vps; we perceive the same "tone or pitch" one octave higher (2:1)
- 4ths and 5ths have 3:2 and 4:3 ratios; then other ratios can be extrapolated
- Greek philosophers associated modes/scales with various emotions, mental states
- Music was associated with the highest sciences, perceived as a gift from Gods, and used in worship in the Greek cults
- Number of pitches used in a scale or melody has undergone change
- Until the Renaissance period, most systems utilized 5 and7 note scales
- Galileo and his contemporaries explored a standardized system of 12 pitches
- Muses inspired creativity
### Dionysus
- Birth of theatre
- Sensuality, love
- Associated with evocative ,loud instruments: Aulos

### Apollo
- Son of Zeus
- God of light, truth, intellect, archery, medicine, music, poetry, and prophetic vision
- Master of the lyre and kithara or cithara (Persian ancestor of guitar)

### Artistic POlarity
- Dionysian:
	- prioritize the emotional
	- the power of human feelings
- Apollonian
	- Artistic expression of intellect, form, balance, sophistication


### Equal Temperament
- In Pythagorean or Just tuning system, intervals are derived via ratios such as 4:3, 5:4, 6:5, etc.
- In Equal Temperament, each half step interval is equidistant, derived by geometric sequence (logarithm)
- In this course: all 12 tones are equidistance

## Terms for Melody
- Range - lowest/highest pitches or tones
- Shape - graphic description (waves, arc, rising line)
- Conjunct - motion by small interval (step)
- Disjunct - motion by large interval (leap or skip)
- Phrase - significant portion of a melody, described by natural points of tension and/or resolution.


## Countermelody
- Countermelody is a secondary melody


## Rhythm
Definition = Pattern of events organized in time

## Time Elements
- Beat - recurring underlying pulse
- Meter - beats organized into repeating patterns of emphasized and de-emphasized beats
- Measure - a delineation of a number of beats into a  unit of 1,2,3,4 or more beats.


3 beats per measure is called a waltz

Syncopation - use of unexpected (unpredictable or intermittent) accents, juxtaposed against a "regular" rhythm.

Polyrhythm - layering of more than one rhythm at a time

Polymeter - alternation between two different meters, Ex(3/4,4/4). Ex: Bernstein's America

Tempo - speed of the beat
- Metronome markings indicate the speed at which a piece should be performed

## Harmony
Harmony is the vertical aspect of music (graphically)

- 2 or more tones sounded simultaneously
- chords are built largely upon thirds
- 3 notes that sound together are called a triad
- Western music largely employs two contexts built upon scales; major and minor
- Chords are generally built from putting together every other note in a scale (usually in groups of 3 or 4 notes)
- The progression of various chords can be called the harmony of a work
- Cadence - a progression of different chords; becomes popular and common in usage.

## Scales
- Scale - a series of tones arranged mostly stepwise
- Scales can be Major or Minor (minor has 3 forms). They are also called "diatomic scales"
- Diatonically, sclaes and chords denote a key or tonality that the listener perceives as "home"
- Chromatic Scale - a series of tones a half-step apart

## Musical Texture

Monophony - One tone(pitch) at a time.
Heterophony - 2 voices describing the same melldoy with embellishment
Homophony - 2 or more voices move together in harmony
Polyphony - 2 or more indepednemnt melodies occurring simulanesouy
Monody - one dominant melody supported by instruments/voices

## Terms and Techniques of Composition

- Counterpoint - 2 or more indepdent melodic lines (polyphony) while prserving a harmonic context
- Retrograde - melodic fragment or motive stated backwards (reverse order)
- Inversion - melodic fragment or motive stated upside down (graphically)

## The Esthetics of Unity

- Repetition - reflected in imitation, canon, improvisation based upon existing form (harmonic or melodic)
- Contrast - relief from main melodic idea, harmony, timbre (instrumentation)
- Variation - disguised use of original or related materials
- Proto-music with these charactersitics leads to form

## Form in Music

- A musical road map
- Sections usually get labels like:
	- Letter names (A,B, etc.)
	- Exposition, Development, Recapitulation
	- First theme, Second theme
- Basic forms have names

## Basic Forms
- Binary AB

- Sonata - a multi-movement solo work
- Symphonic Tone Poem - a one-movement programmatic orchestral work

- Movement - macroform portion of a larger work - typically follows a specific form (each stylistic period has formulaic associations)

## Other Musicall Terms
- Ostinato - a repetitive musical figure offtern underpinning a melody
- Dynamics - indiciate gradations of volume (decibels)
- Duration - length of time over which a note is maintained or sounded
- Timbre (Pronouncer Tamber) - the qualitative color of a sound. Your voice has a specific timbre differetn from anyone else.
- Timbre (color) - dictated by the size, shape, materials of an insturment, combination of instruments, or qualities imparted by the player.
- A clarinet has a timbre that is different from a trumpet, violin, or piano

## Range
- Terms related to ranges are based upon the Latin and Italian terms for vocal range and function, with four main categories:
	- Soprano (high)
	- Alto (medium high)
	- Tenor (medium low)
	- Bass (low)

Symphony
- First form is sonata form
```
A symphony typically consists of four movements, each with its own distinct form and character. Here’s a breakdown of the common forms for each part of a symphony:

  

1. **First Movement: Sonata-Allegro Form**

• **Exposition**: Introduces two contrasting themes (first and second themes) in different keys. The first theme is usually lively and assertive, while the second theme is often more lyrical.

• **Development**: Explores and manipulates the themes introduced in the exposition, often through modulations and variations. This section creates tension and complexity.

• **Recapitulation**: Restates the themes from the exposition, but both are now in the home key, resolving the tension created in the development.

• **Coda**: Concludes the movement, often with a final statement or a reaffirmation of the main theme.

2. **Second Movement: Slow Movement**

• Typically in a slower tempo (e.g., Adagio, Andante).

• Common forms include ternary (ABA), theme and variations, or a lyrical sonata form.

• This movement provides contrast to the energetic first movement, often focusing on expressive melodies and harmonic richness.

3. **Third Movement: Minuet and Trio or Scherzo**

• Minuet and Trio: A dance-like movement in triple meter (3/4 time), structured in an ABA form. The Minuet is followed by a contrasting Trio section, and then the Minuet returns.

• Scherzo: A faster, more vigorous alternative to the Minuet, also typically in ABA form. The Scherzo is playful and lively, often with rhythmic drive and dynamic contrasts.

4. **Fourth Movement: Finale**

• Common forms include rondo (ABACABA), sonata-allegro, or theme and variations.

• This movement is usually brisk and spirited, providing an energetic and satisfying conclusion to the symphony.

• The themes are often lively and the movement showcases the full range of the orchestra’s capabilities.

  

These forms provide a framework for composers, but they are not rigid rules. Composers often experiment and innovate within these structures to create unique and expressive works.
