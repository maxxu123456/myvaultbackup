## Summary of Different People's Contributions

Wundt - started the first psychology labratory. Interested in the mechanicms of simple behaviors, mostly senstaion and perception. He used introspection.

Titchener - focus was on structuralism, has to do with the componetsn of behavior, reduce behavior down into components, advocated for women in science

James - interested in functionalism. darwin. Behaviors have evolved and serve some function. wants to find out the advantage of behavior



Hall - founded American Psychological Association

Ramon y Capal used a staining technique on brain tissue to find out that that there are neurons and Glial Cells.

Type of Glial Cells
- Oligodendrocytes wrap their fat around neurons
- Astrocyte reach out and touch blood vessels and regulate the amount of blood that flow through them locally
- Microglia grabs onto waste material on the brain and get rid of it

Neurons send and receive signals. They have lots of structural proteins which give rise to the elongated part of the cell. The elongated part is called the axon


The ends of the neurons are called axon terminals.

myelin speeds the signal from one neuron to another
